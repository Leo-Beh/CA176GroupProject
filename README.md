Note on test_function_unformatted_k by Zi:
Run this program to obtain a clean version of the df where all characters values such as "76k", replaced with 76000. Use this if you need to do calculations etc. 


Note Q.8 by Zi:
Unsure of what it means by "i.e., the mean of the column 'Avg_Salary_â€™ created in task 6."

Note Q.9 by Zi: 
Before running Q.9 please make sure you have installed "ggplot2", "dplyr", and "readxl" in the console as the program make use of these extensions.

Note Q.10 by Zi:
As part of the function, you can filter the companies by "Job security" and "Work life balance", you can comment out to chose between to have either have only those attributes and just contains those attributes.
